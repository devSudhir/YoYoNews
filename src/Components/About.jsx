      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        An online newspaper (or electronic news or electronic news publication)
        is the online version of a newspaper, either as a stand-alone
        publication or as the online version of a printed periodical.
        <br />
        Going online created more opportunities for newspapers, such as
        competing with broadcast journalism in presenting breaking news in a
        more timely manner. The credibility and strong brand recognition of well
        established newspapers, and the close relationships they have with
        advertisers, are also seen by many in the newspaper industry as
        strengthening their chances of survival.
        <br />
        The movement away from the printing process can also help decrease
        costs. Online newspapers, like printed newspapers, have legal
        restrictions regarding libel, privacy, and copyright,also apply to
        online publications in most countries as in the UK. Also, the UK Data
        Protection Act applies to online newspapers and news pages. Up to 2014,
        the PCC ruled in the UK, but there was no clear distinction between
        authentic online newspapers and forums or blogs. In 2007, a ruling was
        passed to formally regulate UK-based online newspapers, news audio, and
        news video websites covering the responsibilities expected of them and
        to clear up what is, and what isn't an online news publication.
        <br />
        News reporters are being taught to shoot video and to write in the
        succinct manner necessary for Internet news pages. Some newspapers have
        attempted to integrate the Internet into every aspect of their
        operations, e.g., the writing of stories for both print and online, and
        classified advertisements appearing in both media, while other newspaper
        websites may be quite different from the corresponding printed
        newspaper.
